# 🧠 Machine Learning Exercises – Python Practice

Welcome to this beginner-friendly repository of **interactive machine learning exercises using Python**! These short coding tasks are designed to give you hands-on experience with machine learning tools and concepts such as data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.

## 📁 Exercise List

### 1. **Basic Python Expression**

* **Objective:** Print the result of an arithmetic operation.
* **Code:**

  ```python
  d = 6 / 3
  print(d)  # Output: 2.0
  ```

---

### 2. **Importing SVC from scikit-learn**

* **Objective:** Learn how to import the Support Vector Classifier.
* **Code:**

  ```python
  from sklearn.svm import SVC
  ```

---

### 3. **Reading CSV Data into a DataFrame**

* **Objective:** Load S\&P 500 price data from a CSV file into a DataFrame.
* **File Location:** `../data/SPY.csv`
* **Code:**

  ```python
  Df = pd.read_csv('../data/SPY.csv', index_col=0)
  print(Df.head())
  ```

---

### 4. **Training an SVC Model**

* **Objective:** Train a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) using market data.
* **Steps Covered:**

  * Create explanatory features (`Open-Close`, `High-Low`)
  * Define target variable: `+1` if price goes up next day, else `-1`
  * Split the dataset into training and testing sets
  * Fit the model using training data
* **Code:**

  ```python
  svc = SVC()
  clf = svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
  ```

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## 💡 Tips

* Explore the data using `Df.describe()` and `Df.info()` to better understand what you're working with.
* Try visualizing the features using `matplotlib` to see how separable the classes are.
* Use `accuracy_score(y_test, clf.predict(X_test))` to evaluate the model performance.

## 🧩 Upcoming Exercises (Ideas)

* Predicting stock trends with Logistic Regression
* Evaluating models using confusion matrix & ROC-AUC
* Feature scaling and normalization
* Cross-validation techniques
* Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
